Updated sheep breed and render batches multi-breed-sheep.bat and multi-render-thumbs.bat which offer rudimentary, brute-force facility to use CPU affinity command line feature of windows 7. Further work on that remains in TODO list. Laid out further work for that with get-cpu-cores.bat.

Made fix-breed-sheep.bat and fix-render-sheep-thumbs.bat to correct renamed temp files of batch left straggling in incorrect-name state via batch termination.

Updated render-sheep.bat to use free MATH.EXE tool from http://www.hyperionics.com/calculator/index.asp, which is compatible with windows XP and 7, where the (evidently ancient--in computer terms) free CC.EXE command-line calculator, whose source I can no longer find, was not compatible with Windows 7.

Had first revised it to use SET /a native windows command and switch, but discovered again this only does integer arithmetic, where MATH.EXE will do decimel arithmetic.

Batch provides more useful ECHO feedback when run.

Made select-renders.bat which eases selection from large pool of interbred genomes for full-scale renders (see notes in batch).

Found that running multiple VERY large-scale renders (on multiple cores) will choke a typical machine and flam3-render will repeatedly skip renders in all but one process for inability to allocate needed memory resources to render...depending, I suppose, on what size renders you're trying to make :) But a 4-core 2.9 GHZ machine can run four renders of about 1080x1024 at the same time!

06/05/2016 10:22:51 PM revived and figured out how I had this working. Will probably want to port all scripts to 'nix on account maybe newest flam3 renderer / cross-breeder may only be on 'nix (flam3 windows development apparently forsaken). Posting to public repository . . .
