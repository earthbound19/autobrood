Port everything to 'nix /.sh scripts? See if I can get flam3-render to compile and render on 'nix first--render the newest fractal flame types at this writing, 06/05/2016. And in that port, use render flag temp files that are not the original file, as they can more easily and harmlessly be deleted than renaming so many incorrectly named files.

Make the example scripts not hard-coded to their particular directory (use POPD / PUSHD or a 'nix equiv. instead) ; relative paths not absolute.

Update or archive to ./archivesOld.7z all scripts which rely on outdated info (e.g. bad URLs.)

Expand documentation

Correct extracted sheep file names in ./_resources.7z

Modify batches to pull from those resources (if the .7z archive is expanded).
