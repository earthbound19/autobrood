# autobrood
Scripts to mass crossbreed, select and render fractal flames (e.g. "Electric Sheep"). Originally developed for Windows; possible intended port to 'nix pending.

Requires a cygwin environment on windows; or the scripts may work in a 'nix environment with the necessary programs and dependencies installed.

Some necessary dependencies are included. The dependencies for xml_split you must install manually; see the text file in /dependencies.

Double-click examples\example-brood-1\double-click-me.bat to get an idea how it works. Also explore the batch-scripts directory and the _resources.7z archive (7zip required).

At this writing, many of the scripts are defunct for various reasons and need reworking, but many of them work, also.

DEVELOPMENT HISTORY:
Before now: correct.
