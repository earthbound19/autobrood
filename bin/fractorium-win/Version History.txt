1.0.0.18 1/31/2020
--User changes
 -Add entries for 1 and 101 in the affine rotation and scale combo boxes.
 -Allow for resuming a finished render in the final render dialog with a higher quality.
 --This only applies to rendering a single image with no strips.
 --Applies values from coloring & filtering controls in the main window first.
 -Allow for saving the output from the final render dialog as a different image format without starting the rendering process over.
 --Applies values from coloring & filtering controls in the main window first.
 ---These values will only be applied when rendering a single image with no strips.  
 -Make Clear Xaos apply to all when Apply All is checked.
 -Improve performance in the following variations: cpow2, dc_cube, julia3d, julia3dz, julian2, log_db, nblur, npolar, waffle, wavesn, xtrb.
 -Make the xform name field be a standard edit control so it's always editable.
 -Allow for saving EXR as full 32-bit float per component per pixel. Only of engineering interest.
 -Make the thresholds for determining left and right mouse clicks on the color curves control more desirable and intuitive.
 --Larger threshold for left click, same for right click.
 -Add new style sheet called uranium that is reminiscent of the old Winamp color scheme of the same name.
 -Allow for keyboard presses to edit affines.
 --Q: rotate counter clockwise
 --E: rotate clockwise
 --W: move up
 --S: move down
 --A: move left
 --D: move right
 --G: shrink
 --H: grow
 --Hold shift to decrease amount, control to increase amount.
 --P/shift+P toggles visibility of pre/post xforms
 --L/shift+L toggles visibility of all/selected pre/post xforms
 ---Change some menu shortcuts to accommodate these new affine editing shortcuts.
 -Random xaos now just provides values of either 0 or 1, rather than 0-3. Hold control to get the old behavior.
 -Changes to how xaos is "preserved" when adding new xforms, copying xforms and duplicating xforms.
 --Duplicating xforms when no xaos is present in the flame now maintains not using xaos, and keeps all values as one.
 --Duplicating xforms when xaos is present, will result in xaos rows and columns that are the same as the xforms being duplicated, with the new row and column area having values of 1.
 --Duplicating xforms when xaos is present, while control is pressed, will result in xaos rows and columns that have values of 0, with the new row and column area having values of 1.
 ---Copying xforms has the same behavior as duplicating with control pressed.
 --This is a hybrid of the original behavior and the new behavior added a year or so ago.
 -Add new Blur Curve field which controls how blurring increases when moving from the center out.
 -Optimization and correction for hexaplay3D and hexnix3D. They now look the same on CPU/GPU.
 -Major optimization on the GPU for flames which only have one xform, by skipping all random xform selection code.
 -Show/hide selected/all pre/post affine controls have been moved from the affine tab to the toolbar.
 
--Bug fixes
 -Properly detect maximization of final render dialog when on linux.
 -Fix variations: blob2 (broken on CPU), blur_zoom, epispiral, hole, waffle.
 -Fix reading supershape variation from Apophysis.
 -hexaplay3D, hexnix3D and post_smartcrop were wrong on the GPU because they are the rare variations which preserve state between iterations, and inter-iter state preservation has been incorrectly implemented until now.
 -Changing the sub batch size would improperly run the wrong number of iterations.

--Code changes
 -Rand range now uses multiply + shift rather than modulo.
 -Add an include for Variations01.h which will allow a developer to make a build which is fully compatible with flam3.
 -Change some enumeration types to be unsigned char since they only hold a few values.
 -Make StripsRender() handle memsetting the final output image so calling code no longer has to.
 -Make FinalRenderEmberController<T>::SaveCurrentRender() return the path that the image was actually saved to.
 -Flip precalc sina/cosa and apply everywhere by flipping the usage. Flam3 had these reversed and it made the code confusing to read.
 -Recreate the final render dialog each time it's shown.
 -Pre/post variations are now checked for precalcs and global function requirements when creating the OpenCL kernel code.
 -Change some enumeration types to uchar from uint.
 -Add new field to Ember called m_BlurCurve, and the corresponding xml field is called "blur_curve".
 -Some functions in Affine2D made const.
 -Some arguments in some member functions of GLEmberController made const.
 -Change in the index at which points and variation state are preserved between kernel calls.

1.0.0.17 6/24/2019
--User changes
 -Add hex_modulus, inkdrop, Truchet_hex_crop and Truchet_hex_fill variations.
 -Remove "Current" option for xform selection options. Now only Selected and All are available. If none are explicitly selected, it defaults to current being selected.
 -Prevent mouse scrolling when panning the image with the middle mouse button down.
 
--Bug fixes
 -Prevent the minus key from changing the current xform when being pressed in a textbox or spinner.
 -Fix xform selection logic to prevent selecting hidden pre and post xforms.

1.0.0.16 6/03/2019
--User changes:
 -Allow changes which do not trigger a full render to be added to the undo list.

--Bug fixes:
 -auger, falloff2, falloff3, hypertile, hypertile1, hypertile2, mirror_x, mirror_y and mirror_z variations were wrong.
 -Dragging library items to a new position was not properly resetting the current flame pointer, so subsequent edits would unintentionally overwrite different flames.
 -Switching between SP/DP was resetting palette rotation.
 -Right clicking when showing only current affines caused a crash.

--Code changes:
 -Optimize hypercrop.
 -Make dust, sin, cos, tan, sec, csc, cot, sinh, cosh, tanh, sech, csch, coth match Chaotica.
 -Case insensitive comparisons via stricmp() were wrong on non-Windows systems.

1.0.0.15 5/13/2019
--User changes:
 -Add a new stylesheet named lightdark.qss that provides a more modern looking dark theme.
 -Show common folder locations such as documents, downloads, pictures in the sidebar in all file dialogs.
 -Warning message about exceeding memory in final render dialog now suggests strips as the solution to the problem.
 -Strips now has a tooltip explaining what it does.
 -Allow more digits in the spinners on the color section the flame tab.
 -Added a field called K2 which is an alternative way to set brightness, ignored when zero.
 -Add manually adjustable size spinners in the final render dialog. Percentage scale and absolute size are fully synced.
 -Default prefix in final render is now the filename when doing animations (coming from sequence section of the library tab).
 -Changed the elliptic variation back to using a less precise version for float, and a more precise version for double. The last release had it always using double.
 -New applied xaos table that shows a read-only view of actual weights by taking the base xform weights and multiplying them by the xaos values.
 -New table in the xaos tab that gives a graphical representation of the probability that each xform is chosen, with and without xaos.
 -Add button to transpose the xaos rows and columns.
 -Add support for importing .chaos files from Chaotica.
 --Pasting back to Chaotica will work for most, but not all, variations due to incompatible parameter names in some.
 -Curves are now splines instead of Bezier. This adds compatibility with Chaotica, but breaks it for Apophysis. Xmls are still pastable, but the color curves will look different.	
 --The curve editor on the palette tab can now add points by clicking on the lines and remove points by right clicking on the points themselves, just like Chaotica.
 --Splines are saved in four new xml fields: overall_curve, red_curve, green_curve and blue_curve.
 -Clear all color curves when clicking Reset while holding down Ctrl.
 -Interpolate color curves when generating a sequence.
 -Allow for specifying the percentage of a sub batch each thread should iterate through per kernel call when running with OpenCL. This gives a roughly 1% performance increase due to having to make less kernel calls while iterating.
 --This field is present for interactive editing (where it's not very useful), in the final render dialog and on the command line.
 --On the command line, this is specified as --sbpctth for EmberRender and EmberAnimate.
 -Allow double clicking to toggle the supersample field in the flame tab between 1 and 2 for easily checking the effect of the field.
 -When showing affine values as polar coordinates, show angles normalized to 360 to match Chaotica.
 -Fuse Count spinner now toggles between 15 and 100 when double clicking for easily checking the effect of the field.
 -Added field for limiting the range in the x and y direction that the initial points are chosen from.
 --This has no effect for many variations, but has a noticeable effect for some.
 -Linux installer now uses a technology called AppImage which makes installations painless and totally dependency free, like it's been on windows for the past 20 years.
 --The AppImage is wrapped in a .deb package, so installation remains familiar to ubuntu/mint users.
 --RPM installer is now provided for Red Hat users.
 -Added new variations:

--Bug fixes:
 -Bounds sign was flipped for x coordinate of world space when center was not zero.
 -Right clicking and dragging spinner showed menu on mouse up, even if it was very far away.
 -Text boxes for size in final render dialog were hard to type in. Same bug as xform weight used to be so fixed the same way.
 -Fix spelling to be plural in toggle color speed box.
 -Stop using the blank user palette to generate flames. Either put colored palettes in it, or exclude it from randoms.
 -Clicking the random palette button for a palette file with only one palette in it would freeze the program.
 -Clicking none scale in final render did not re-render the preview.
 -Use less precision on random xaos. No need for 12 decimal places.
 -The term sub batch is overloaded in the options dialog. Change the naming and tooltip of those settings for cpu and opencl.
 --Also made clear in the tooltip for the default opencl quality setting that the value is per device.
 -The arrows spinner in palette editor appears like a read-only label. Made it look like a spinner.
 -Fix border colors for various spin boxes and table headers in the style sheet. Requires reload.
 -Fix a bug in the bwraps variation which would produce different results than Chaotica and Apophysis.
 -Synth was allowed to be selected for random flame generation when using an Nvidia card but it shouldn't have been because Nvidia has a hard time compiling synth.
 -A casting bug in the OpenCL kernels for log scaling and density filtering was preventing successful compilations on Intel iGPUs. Fixed even though we don't support anything other than AMD and Nvidia.
 -Palette rotation (click and drag) position was not being reset when loading a new flame.
 -When the xform circles were hidden, opening and closing the options dialog would improperly reshow them.
 -Double click toggle was broken on integer spin boxes.
 -Fixed tab order of some controls.
 -Creating a palette from a jpg in the palette editor only produced a single color.
 --Needed to package imageformats/qjpeg.dll with the Windows installer.
 -The basic memory benchmark test flame was not really testing memory. Make it more spread out.
 -Remove the temporal samples field from the flame tab, it was never used because it's only an animation parameter which is specified in the final render dialog or on the command line with EmberAnimate.
 -The waves2b variation was never fully implemented on the GPU when the pwx or pwy value was between -1e-4 and 1e-4. Now the implementation is complete.
 -EmberBench.ps1 would not run on linux.
 -Deleting a flame in the library tree was taking three tries.
 -Undo a change made last year which gave the wrong color index for final xforms when generating a sequence.
  
--Code changes:
 -Add IsEmpty() to Palette to determine if a palette is all black.
 -Attempt to avoid selecting a blank palette in PaletteList::GetRandomPalette().
 -Add function ScanForChaosNodes() and some associated helper functions in XmlToEmber.
 -Make variation param name correction be case insensitive in XmlToEmber.
 -Add SubBatchPercentPerThread() method to RendererCL.
 -Override enterEvent() and leaveEvent() in DoubleSpinBox and SpinBox to prevent the context menu from showing up on right mouse up after already leaving the spinner.
 -Filtering the mouse wheel event in TableWidget no longer appears to be needed. It was probably an old Qt bug that has been fixed.
 -Gui/ember syncing code in the final render dialog needed to be reworked to accommodate absolute sizes.
 -Add fma() to a few more places in the OpenCL code.
 -Add a new C# project named apoconv that attempts to convert Apophysis plugins to Fractorium style Variation classes. It's not entirely perfect, but gets most of the job done much more quickly than doing so manually.
 -Remove unused OpenCL functions from variations: elliptic, poincare, mask, bMod, bSwirl, bTransform, bCollide, farblur, popcorn2_3D, falloff, falloff2, falloff3, crackle2, waves2b, hypercrop, depth_gaussian2, depth_sine, depth_sine2, dust, asteria, vibration, vibration2, arctanh, smartshape, squares, starblur2, Truchet.
 --Add code in EmberTester to automatically detect such unused functions.
 -No longer assume palettes are 256 elements. Can now read longer palettes.
 -Ensure OpenCL images always get written when created.
 -Change some menu capitalization to make the text easier on the eyes.

1.0.0.14 10/20/2018
--Bug fixes
 -File saving was broken.

--Code changes
 -File saving and opening dialogs were shared between a single object which was causing trouble. Make them all use their own objects.

1.0.0.13 10/9/2018
--User changes
 -Disable Start button in final render dialog when Pause is clicked.

--Bug fixes
 -Rapidly changing spinner values was causing the OpenCL renderer to report a failure, when it was really just aborting.

--Code changes
 -Renderers never internally set abort to true due to a failure. Abort is only set to true by the calling code.

1.0.0.12 9/30/2018
--User changes
 -Add a button to swap the pre and post affine values for all selected xforms.

--Bug fixes
 -Remove the ability to change spinner values with +=-=, it was conflicting with other things and added no real value.
 -All file dialog opening in Linux would freeze. No longer using native file dialogs, they are broken.
 -Set default open path to the desktop if there is no settings file present, which will be the case on the first run.
 -Amphibole_Supergroup.ugr palette had an invalid character in two of the palette names.

--Code changes
 -Change some table header padding styles to work with new Qt. Qss reload is required.
 -Ensure the open folder path setting always has a valid string in it before opening a folder.

1.0.0.11 9/27/2018
--User changes
 -Double clicking on width or height spinner now resizes both, but scales to the one double clicked.
 -Make variation tree background colors for zero and non-zero be theme-able.
 -Give tabs a height of 4px in the qss files. Looks a little large on 4k screens, but just right on HD screens which are much more common.
 -Allow for toggling whether to interpolate between colors in the palette editor, or to do hard cuts between colors.
 -Allow for adjusting spinner values with the + = or up arrow keys to increase, and - _ or down arrow keys to decrease.
 -Allow for responding to global presses of + = and - _ to cycle up or down to specify which xform is set as the current one.
 -Allow for adding "layers" via xaos which will add a user-specified number of xforms, and set certain xaos values to 0 or 1.
 -Add a new menu item under the Edit menu to copy the OpenCL iteration kernel source to the clipboard.
 -Show text on the status bar which indicates that an OpenCL kernel compilation is taking place.
 -Show xform name on xform combo box when expanded. Adjust size to fit all names.
 -Prevent QSS dialog from styling its editor, which makes it easier to see text when creating styles which have custom colors for text boxes.
 -Attempt to preserve xaos when adding xform copies. Note this is not an exact copy, but just a preservation of some values based on position.
 -Add some acceleration to the changing of spinner values when dragging the right mouse button to adjust.
 -Make the pivot be the center of the viewable area when doing drag/rotate/scale with the right mouse button.
 --Clamp minimum scale to 10
 --Draw a line from the mouse position to the pivot.
 -Keep a cache of the last added final xform with each flame so that it can be quickly added, removed, then added back for testing its effect.
 --This is not saved with the xml file and is solely for interactive editing.
 -Add buttons to copy and paste affine transforms.
 -Show xform names on the column headers of the xaos table.
 -Add a color-coded third column to the variations tree which shows any properties of each variation which are non-standard. The column header has a tooltip which describes what the colors mean.
 -Use a green dot for the x axis and purple dot for the y axis when drawing affines to help distinguish them more easily.
 -Change the thickness of some of the lines used to draw the affine..
 -Draw post affine circles using dashed lines.
 -Draw a transparent circle over hovered xforms.
 -Change how xforms respond to dragging. Rotate only is now the default, and scale will only happen with shift.
 --Optionally do scale and rotate when holding shift, via a setting in the options dialog.
 -Make the About box more presentable.
 -Change qss files to make the text box in the About box be the same color as the one in the style dialog, so the link text is easier to see.
 --This requires reloading the qss file.
 -Add new palettes from user Rubydeva.

--Bug fixes
 -Fix out of bounds crash in EmberGenome.
 -Show grid setting was not being preserved during program run, only on close.
 -Zooming with the mouse wheel was broken for images whose size is greater than the screen area.
 -Manually typing xform weight when the xform had a name kept getting interrupted.
 -Fix up some table layouts which seemed to have regressed/decayed over time for reasons unknown.
 -Using undo/redo would create a new flame in the library every time.
 -Solo was not being preserved when using undo/redo.
 -File filtering in open and save dialogs was broken.
 -Right clicking on integer spin boxes was causing the context menu to pop up, when it should be suppressed just like in double spin boxes.
 -Deleting xforms was still broken.
 -Snapping when dragging and holding ctrl was wrong sometimes.
 -The program would very rarely crash on startup due to some values being in an uninitialized state.
 -Pre/post assign method was wrong for Sphereblur, Concentric, RandCubes and PixelFlow.
 -Avoid an occasional divide by zero in the OpenCL renderer when using the interactive editor.

--Code changes
 -Update dependencies build script to use the latest version of openexr and other libraries.
 -Update windows platform version.
 -Make the solo flag be a part of the flame data now.
 -Fix some tabification in the OpenCL code for EllipticVariation.
 -Fix tabification in the varState code for OpenCL.
 -Add an event called m_CompileBegun to RendererCL that is called right before an OpenCL compile is begun.
 --This required making RendererCLBase not a pure virtual base class. Member functions just return defaults.
 -Filter key presses on main window to only process the third one. This is due to Qt triggering three events for every key press.
 -The palette preview table was installing an event filter for seemingly no reason. Remove it.
 -Mark certain virtual functions as override in SpinBox and DoubleSpinBox.
 -Refactor the code for adding and pasting xforms into a single global static function called AddXformsWithXaos().
 -Change almost every variation to use fma() in OpenCL when doing computations of the form a * b + c. This provides a slight speedup, mostly in double precision mode.
 -Also apply fma() to affine calculations.
 -Cleanup of OpenGL affine drawing code.
 -Separate the concept of hovering and selecting xforms.
 -Update dependencies build script to use the latest version of openexr and other libraries.
 -Update windows platform version.
 -Make Hypershift2 use MwcNextRange() instead of MwcNext() %.
 -Add m_HasPre to Xform similar to m_HasPost, to skip application of the affine if it's the ID matrix (in this case just assign the input x and y points). This gives a 5% speedup.
 -Only treat NaN as a bad point. Previously anything too close to zero or too close to infinity was considered a bad value. Only testing for NaN allows for infinity to be processed. Denormals are still flushed to zero.
 -Use exact comparisons in IsID() and IsZero() in Affine2D.
 -For rendering with OpenCL on the command line and in the final render dialog, use an optimized kernel that does a direct assignment for any affines which are ID.

1.0.0.10 6/17/2018
--User changes
 -No longer constrain pitch, yaw or depth spinners to -180 - 180.

--Bug fixes
 -Properly set color index on padded xforms.
 -Adding a padding final xform included a linear variation with a weight of zero to not appear empty. Made it have a weight of 1.
 -Always write animate tag on final xform when saving to Xml.
 -Motion was being applied to the wrong flame in SheepTools::Edge(), so apply it to the correct one.
 -Prevent divide by zero when normalizing variation weights.
 -Was accidentally adding the placeholder value of -9999 for motion_offset to varation weights and parameters when applying motion. Set to zero if no value present.
 -Clamp flame rotation values to -180 - 180 when reading a flame from Xml.
 -Events were not properly wired for user changes in the random rotations per blend controls in the sequencer.
 -Fix major UI bugs with sequencer min/max random controls which made it nearly impossible to hand type values.
 -Values from rotations per blend and rotations per blend max were not being saved to file between program runs.
 -Checking animate for an xform was not applied to all flames even if Apply All was checked.
 -Changing interpolation type, temporal filter width, temporal type, and affine interpolation type were not actually saving to the flame when changed.
 -Grid on the main window was not being drawn at the right scale initially due to some OpenGL initialization occurring in the wrong order.
 -Severe bugs in sequence generation code:
  --Improperly detected padding xforms.
  --When looking for specific variations during xform aligning, only presence was detected, when it should have been presence plus a weight greater than zero.
  --When adding specific variations during xform aligning, must first remove any variations of that type.
  --Two variables were unsigned when they should have been signed. This prevented large blocks of code from ever executing.
  --When interpolating affines, an EPS that was too small was used, causing affine values to interpolate incorrectly. Instead use 1e-10 to ensure results equal to flam3.

--Code changes
 -Modify FractoriumEmberController::UpdateXform() to pass the selected xform index as well as the absolute index to func().
 
1.0.0.9 5/13/2018
--Bug fixes
 -Pausing did not work when using OpenCL renderer.

1.0.0.8 5/4/2018
--User changes
 -Change variation spin boxes to only show the precision needed, and also allow scientific notation.
 -Added pixel_flow variation from user bezo97.
 -Add two new variations, hypercrop and hypershift2.
 -Add the ability to drag the rotation of the current palette via the palette preview table.
 -Allow for pausing and resuming of final renders.
 -Allow for animating final xforms.
 -More detailed diagnostics when any action in the OpenCL renderer fails.
 -Allow for creating an OpenCL renderer which does not share a texture with the main window, and instead manually copies its final output image from GPU to CPU then back to GPU.
 -Allow running command line programs from outside of the folder the executable is in on Windows, by adding the install folder to the PATH variable. This was needed to properly find the palette file (even though it's mostly unneeded).

--Bug fixes
 -Fix a variety of very strange bugs when clicking around on palettes in different files in the palette editor.
 -Fix bug where animate flag was not properly being set when checking the checkbox, and also did not work correctly when Apply All was checked.
 -Text was not properly being copied out of the Info | Bounds text box.

--Code changes
 -Convert OpenGL drawing code to use GLSL.
 -Always use double precision extension defines in OpenCL programs, even if DP is not selected. This is because elliptic now always uses DP.
 -Only instantiate float version of Palette and PaletteList, no need for double since it's never used.
 -Allow for FinalRenderDialog to be queried on whether it's currently rendering.
 -Remove Renderer::AccumulatorToFinalImage(v4F* pixels, size_t finalOffset), it's no longer needed or makes sense.
 -Controllers no longer keep track of shared status, it's kept inside the renderers.
 -Make getter functions in FractoriumOptionsDialog be public.

1.0.0.7 12/22/2017
--User changes
 -Support 4k monitors, and in general, properly scale any monitor that is not HD.
 -Allow for a spatial filter of radius zero, which means do not use a spatial filter.
 -Add new variations: concentric, cpow3, helicoid, helix, rand_cubes, rays1, rays2, rays3, sphereblur.
 -Use a new method for computing elliptic which is more precise. Developed by Discord user Claude.
 -Remove the 8 variation per xform limitation on the GPU.
 -Allow for loading the last flame file on startup, rather than randoms.
 -Use two different default quality values in the interactive renderer, one each for CPU and GPU.
 -Creating linked xforms was using non-standard behavior. Make it match Apo and also support creating multiple linked xforms at once.

--Bug fixes
 -No variations in an xform used to have the same behavior as a single linear variation with weight 1. While sensible, this breaks backward compatibility. No variations now sets the output point to zeroes.
 -Prevent crashing the program when adjusting a value on the main window while a final render is in progress.
 -The xaos table was inverted.
 -Place the xforms and palette tabs in a scroll area to prevent weird sizing problems on low resolution monitors.
 -Allow group dragging and floating of dock widgets.
 -Make some tables auto size to their contents because some text appeared obscured on Linux.
 -Opening an Xml was not properly setting the background field on the GUI, even though it was correctly parsed and used.
 -Clicking random palette when using a palette file with 2 palettes could lead to a program freeze.

--Code changes

--User changes
 -Add support for Exr files which use 32-bit floats for each RGBA channel.
 -Allow for clearing an individual color curve.
 -Allow for saving multiple image types in EmberRender and EmberAnimate. All writes are threaded.
 -Remove --bpc command line argument. Add format png16 as a replacement.

--Code changes
 -Improve the coloring code during final accum by getting rid of the last remnants of unnecessary scaling to 255 from flam3.
 -New dependency on OpenEXR.
 -Allow Curves class to interact with objects of a different template type.
 -Make m_Curves member of Ember always use float as template type.
 -Set the length of the curves array to always be 2^16 which should offer enough precision with new 32-bit float pixel types.
 -Set pixel types to always be 32-bit float. This results in a major reduction of code in the final accumulation part of Renderer.h/cpp.
 -Remove corresponding code from RendererCL and FinalAccumOpenCLKernelCreator.
 -Remove Transparency, NumChannels and BytesPerPixel setters from Renderer.h/cpp.
 -Add new global functions to format final image buffers and place all alpha calculation and scaling code in them.

 -Use static_partitioner in all parallel_for() calls.
 -Use some CPU defines in CL code.
 -Code in RendererClDevice::Init() to detect Nvidia was wrong even thought it technically worked.
 -crackle now uses real_t* for cache rather than real2. This is what was causing the bug.
 -Make the local offsets array used in crackle a precalc since it's the same for all. This reduces register pressure.
 -Get rid of all usages of real3, just to be safe since Nvidia doesn't like them.
 -#define TOTAL_GLOBAL_SIZE_END in the OpenCL iteration kernel just for debugging purposes to see how large the parvars buffer is.
 -Remove some unused functions.

1.0.0.4 07/01/2017
--User changes
 -Add support for adjusting xform color indices in the palette editor. Fixed palettes can now be displayed there, but they will have no color arrows as they are not editable.
 -Add support for independent dimension scaling in the EmberRender and EmberAnimate programs to bring them in line with the final render dialog Fractorium. The options are -ws, -hs and -scaletype.
 -Limit size of the left side of the palette editor.
 -dark.qss is now per-OS.
 
--Bug fixes
 -Opacity was accidentally being set to zero sometimes which could cause flickering when animating.
 -Fractorium would occasionally freeze after dismissing the final render dialog because some values were not properly re-initialized.
 -File paths with a space in them did not work in the command line programs.
 -Any Xml file in the search paths would erroneously be treated as a palette file.
 -The following variations were wrong: coshq, cothq.
 -During iteration, the color index could become nan if all xform color speeds were negative. This could lead to bad results on the GPU. Fix to check for nan. Minimal speed difference.
 -Fix crash when opening palette editor with a flame whose palette specifies no originating file.
 -Any measurement of time which was sub-millisecond was wrong.
  
--Code changes
 -Remove VS 2013 build files.

 -Allow FractoriumEmberController<T>::UpdateXform() to be able to apply the action to an xform at a specific index.
 -Remove old code blocks build files that were never used.
 -Make GetPath() return empty string if no path is present in the passed in file path.
 -GetTotalXform() was always counting the final xform, even if it was unused.
 -Make the following variations safer by using Zeps(): sinq, sinhq, secq, sechq, tanq, tanhq, cosq, coshq, cotq, cothq, cscq, cschq, estiq.
 -Always pass -cl-no-signed-zeros -cl-denorms-are-zero to kernel compiles for both single and double.
 -Flush all denormals to zero for all executable programs. This will likely lead to a speedup for badly behaving flames.
 -Make the following variations safer by using Zeps(): conic, bipolar, edisc, whorl, tan, csc, cot, tanh, sech, csch, coth, auger, bwraps, hypertile3d, hypertile3d1, ortho, poincare, rational3, barycentroid, sschecks, cscq, cschq, scry_3D, splitbrdr, hexcrop, nblur, crob.
 -Small optimization for gdoffs, use precalcAtanYX.
 -Properly propagate z through circlesplit, cylinder2 and tile_log variations.
 -Some values in truchet_fill could've been NaN.
 -Make most installation files read only.
 -Use auto in more places.
  
1.0.0.3 04/06/2017
--User changes
 -Remove opacity adjustment from legacy flam3 code base, it can lead to erroneous results.

--Bug fixes
 -Double clicking min/max DE filter spinners would not trigger a render reset if the other was non-zero. The fix has the downside of triggering a change event when scrolling even if the value is already capped. This is an acceptable tradeoff.
 -On delete, select the library item closest to the last one which was deleted.

1.0.0.2 03/15/2017
--User changes
 -Add many tooltips to help clarify functionality.
 -Select multiple flames in library for del/move. Still only one allowed to be set as the current.
 -Show checkbox for current flame. Remember this is not necessarily what's selected.
 -User can now drag a square to select xforms, which keeps in sync with checkboxes.
 -Remove --nframes from command line. Replace with new params: --loopframes, --interpframes, --interploops.

  --Add these to Fractorium as checkboxes.
 -Apply All now also works for toggling animate flag on xforms.
 -Options dialog now allows user to set whether double click toggles spinners, or right click does.
 -Allow toggling on spinners whose minimum value is not zero.
 -Add a palette editor.
 -Add support for reading .ugr/.gradient/.gradients palette files.
 -Allow toggling display of image, affines and grid.
 -Add new variations: cylinder2, circlesplit, tile_log, truchet_fill, waves2_radial.

--Bug fixes
 -Selecting final and non-final xforms, and then dragging the non-final did not drag the final with it.
 -Selecting all xforms when a final was present, then deleting crashed the program.
 -Selecting multiple xforms and rotating them would produce the wrong rotation.
 -Switching between SP and DP kept reapplying the palette adjustments.
 -cpow2 was wrong.
 -Xaos has been wrong this entire time on the GPU because it was not selecting from the unweighted distributions on the very first iteration when fusing.
 -Palettes with rapid changes in color would produce slightly different outputs from Apo/Chaotica. This was due to a long standing bug from flam3.
 -Use exec() on Apple and show() on all other OSes for dialog boxes.
 -Trying to render a sequence with no frames would crash.
 -Remove support for ppm files in the command line programs, it's an outdated format.
 -Better handling when parsing flames using different encoding, such as unicode and UTF-8.
 -Save palettes values in flame files as uppercase.

 -Move build system to Visual Studio 2015 and Qt 5.8.
 -SSE used during addition of points to the histogram.
 -Remove last remnants of old flam3 C code and replace with C++.
 -Remove unused code involving tbb::task_group.
 -Make settings and PaletteList objects be global shared_ptr singletons, so they don't have to be passed around.
 -Make all types concerning palettes be floats, including PaletteTableWidgetItem.
 -PaletteTableWidgetItem is no longer templated because all palettes are float.
 -Include the source colors for user created gradients.

--Bug fixes
 -Highlight power values less than 0 were accidentally disabled on the UI.

1.0.0.0 06/17/2016
--User changes
 -Officially transition out of beta into a full 1.0 release.
 -Add new options to EmberGenome to better help assess which variations have certain characteristics. The options are:
  --sumvars: Display the names of all regular variations which have the default behavior of summing their outputs and exit.
  --assignvars: Display the names of all regular variations which have the non-standard behavior of assigning their outputs and exit.
  --ppsumvars: Display the names of all pre/post variations which have the non-standard behavior of summing their outputs and exit.
  --ppassignvars: Display the names of all pre/post variations which have the default behavior of assigning their outputs and exit.
  --dcvars: Display the names of all variations which use direct coloring and exit.
  --statevars: Display the names of all variations which alter their state on each iteration and exit.
  --parvars: Display the names of all variations which have parameters and exit.
  --nonparvars: Display the names of all variations which do not have parameters (weight only) and exit.
 -Add two new options to EmberGenome which are used when generating an animation sequence:
  --startcount: Add this number to the filename of each flame.
  --padding: Override the automatically calculated amount of padding zeroes added to each filename.
 -Allow for filtering in the Variations Dialog based on the same types listed in the EmberGenome options.
 -Add a button to randomize both pre and post affine transforms to values between -1 to 1.
 -Add animation sequence creation to Fractorium.
 -Add fractorium.com link to the about box.

--Bug fixes
 -Fix final render dialog failure when minimizing and restoring during a render on Linux. Note this bug was not present on Windows.
 -Switching between SP and DP before previews had finished would set the current flame back to the first one in the file.
 -Prevent filenames in command line programs from using scientific notation when rendering a large number of frames.
 -Fix tab orders to match newer GUI items which were overlooked in previous releases.
 -Re-render previews if transparency value in the options dialog was changed. Re-rendering was previously only done if early clip or y axis up was changed.
 -Use transparency when rendering thumbnail previews.
  
--Code changes
 -Make VariationList vectors have const elements since no callers should ever change them.
 -Add new function to VariationList to retrieve a const ref to the parametric variations.
 -Move some search functions out of EmberTester and into EmberCommon.h.
 -More correctly populate VariationList::m_ParametricVariations and VariationList::m_NonParametricVariations to account for variations which have params only used for precalc.
 -Consolidate some of the code in VariationList which searches by name.
 -Use references rather than pointers when grabbing pre/post affines.
 -Wrap EmberCommon.h in a namespace called EmberCommon.
 -Move FormatName() from EmberGenome to EmberCommon.h/cpp
 -Add a prefix parameter to EmberFile::DefaultFilename() to allow for creating a default filename for sequences.
 -When showing the final render dialog, allow specifying where it came from: the toolbar or the render sequence button.
 -Refactor all preview rendering code out into its own class hierarchy with overrides for the main window and the final render dialog.
 -Remove all preview render cancelling functions, they are now built into the new class hierarchy and a new render will not start until the previous one is stopped.
 -Add two new function ConstrainLow() and ConstrainHigh() which wrap constraining two min/max spinboxes to each others' values.
 -Add a bool to FractoriumEmberControllerBase::CopyEmberFile() to specify whether to copy the main file or the sequence file. This is somewhat of a hack and was done in a rush.
 -Add a bool to FractoriumEmberControllerBase::SetEmberFile() to specify whether to move the file rather than copy. This is used in FinalRenderEmberController and improves efficiency.
 -Add wrapper functions for variations filter dialog settings.
 -Tooltip cleanups.
 -General code cleanup.
 
0.9.9.6 Beta 05/05/2016
--User changes
	-The concept of "saving back to file in memory" has been removed. The current ember is saved back to memory whenever the render completes and the thumbnail will be updated each time.
		--Edits will not save back to the file in memory on render completion when preview renderer is running.
	-Make the default interpolation type be smooth.
	-Highlight power is now on by default.
	-Better handling of crossed min/max DE filter values on the GUI.
	-Changes to spatial and density filter values will no longer restart the entire render because a fixed size gutter is used.
	-crackle is now 5-10 times faster as a result of using cached values as is done on the CPU. These were previously omitted due to a bug elsewhere in the code that was erroneously attributed to the crackle caching mechanism.
	-Allow for adjustments on the Flame tab to apply to all open flames in the file.
		--Add apply all functionality to flatten/unflatten menu items.
	-Add two new buttons to the color tab to randomize and toggle the xform color indices.
	-Change drag n drop behavior: the default is now to append, hold Ctrl to overwrite.
	-Set max value of zoom to 25 because it will crash with values around 28 or 29 due to numeric overflow when scaling quality.
	-Update links in About Dialog.
	-Move the color curves control to the Palette tab.
	-Change dark.qss to hide dotted selection outline around checkboxes. Users must reload it to take effect.
	-Allow for dragging around flames in the library tab. This is useful for setting up the order of an animation.
	-Make the opening of large files in Fractorium much more efficient when not-appending.
	-Make the opening of large files in all EmberRender and EmberAnimate more efficient.
	-Better error reporting when opening files.
	-Command line programs now default to using double precision.
		--Report precision in command line programs.
	-Cleanup some options text for the command line programs.
	-Make randoms in EmberGenome have default dimensions of 1920 x 1080.
	-Changed/removed several command line options:
		--Remove the option --intpalette to format the palette in the xml as ints. If they are not hex formatted, then they should always be float. This option was pointless.
		--The --bits argument has been removed and replaced with --sp to specify single precision. If omitted, DP is used.
		--Remove the --seed option, it was never used.
		--Remove the --sub_batch_size option, it has been part of the Xml for a long time.
		--Remove --hex_palette option for EmberRender, it only makes sense in EmberAnimate and EmberGenome.
		--Set enable_jpg_comments and enable_png_comments to false by default. It was a very bad idea to have them be true because it reveals the flame parameters used to render the image which many artists guard closely.
		--Remove --time option for EmberAnimate, it was redundant with --frame.
		--Make --enable_jpg_comments and --enable_png_comments just be bools that when present mean true, rather than having to specify =true.
		--Add a new argument --ts for EmberAnimate to allow the user to specify the temporal samples value to use for the entire animation. Useful for testing.
		--Remove the --strip option from EmberGenome. It was useless and was likely just a carry over from flam3 during its early debugging stages when testing strips.
		--Prevent --inter and --rotate in EmberGenome from rotating backward before the first flame since it doesn't really make sense.
	-Support reading cam_zoom from xml as zoom since JWildfire uses cam_zoom.
	-Ensure every loaded flame has at least one xform in it.
	-Always force times of each flame to increase from zero when saving a file.
	-Remove check for times when doing a sequence in EmberGenome because the original times are never used there.
	
--Bug fixes
	-Place last.flame in ~/.config/fractorium on Linux.
	-Attempt to prevent crash when selecting OpenCL in the final render dialog when unsupported hardware is present.
		--This works by selecting the last known good device in the main window.
	-Correctly label interpolation types in the combo in the animation table on the Flame tab.
	-Remove extra space in info tree text when dealing with a linked xform.
	-Update summary xform name field whenever xform name changes.
	-Get rid of selection border on summary tab xform tree cells.
	-Only add variations from Xml that have a non-zero weight. There seemed to be spurious flattens coming from Apo with a weight of 0.
	-Get rid of leftover artifacts that would appear on preview thumbnails when either switching SP/DP or re-rendering previews.
	-Filename extension was not being appended on Linux when saving as Xml, thus making it impossible to drag that file back in because drop is filtered on extension.
	-Continuous update was broken.
	-Force repaint on xform selection checkbox change to ensure circles are immediately drawn around selected xforms.
	-dc_perlin was crashing on Nvidia when using SP.
	-Crash when opening an Xml with less than 2 flames in it.
	-Fix crash when using smooth interpolation in EmberGenome.
	-Print error and exit EmberGenome when sequencing if times are not sorted.
	-Multi-GPU synchronization was not actually thread safe and was likely doing less iters than requested. It is now properly synchronized.
	-The saving of last.flame during editing was appending the file when it should have been replacing.
	-It was impossible for EmberGenome to create a random flame. It can now be done by specifying no arguments: EmberGenome.exe
	-Crossing in EmberGenome was not logging the performed actions to the edit Xml tag.
	-Apply sub batch size and fuse count to template files used on the command line.
	-Use new default filter types (log and smooth) with template files.
	-Properly seed rands in EmberAnimate when specifying --isaac_seed and using more than one device with --opencl.
  
--Code changes
	-Make DE block size always be 16x16, this should help stability on some Nvidia cards. No changes for AMD cards since they were that size already.
		--Since the block size is now so small, do not reduce it further when supersampling.
	-Clean up some variable names and documentation around OpenCL DE to be more clear.
	-Gutters are now a fixed size of 8 * supersample.
	-Use stl data() member to get pointer to first element instead of &vec[0].
	-Eliminate extra calls in renderer to ComputeBounds(), CreateSpatialFilter() and CreateTemporalFilter() to only be done at the start of a render.
	-Another attempt at vectorizing LogScaleDensityFilter(). Vectorizes, but not sure if it helps.
	-Some other loop optimizations in Renderer.
	-No longer check temporal samples in response to some control changes, they are always 1 in the interactive renderer.
	-Make summing histograms from one or more secondary devices to the primary a little more elegant by using HOST_PTR. This requires one less copy.
	-Move GCC compiler spec to C++14. Building with 5.3 now on linux.
	-Use inline member data initializers.
	-Make a #define for static for use in Utils.h to make things a little cleaner.
	-Make various functions able to take arbitrary collections as their parameters rather than just vectors.
	-Make library collection a list rather than vector. This alleviates the need to re-sync pointers whenever the collection changes.
	-Subclass QTreeWidget for the library tree. Two new files added for this.
	-Remove all usage of #ifdef ROW_ONLY_DE in DEOpenCLKernelCreator, it was never used.
	-Add move constructor and assignment operator to EmberFile.
	-Add the ability to use a pointer to outside memory in the renderer for the vector of Ember<T>.
	-Make a lot more functions const where they should be.
	-Remove save back to file in memory icon, document-hf-insert.png.
	-Use raw array of floats in OpenCL for perlin noise, rather than float3/double3.
	-Add some default cases to dc_perlin.
	-Redo singleton pattern yet again.
	-Pass XML_PARSE_HUGE to xmlReadMemory() to allow for reading large Xml files.
	-Optimize Interpolater by making it a non-static class by adding some members used for caching values during interpolation.
	-Cache values in SheepTools as well, which was already a non-static class.
	-Use cerr in SheepTools instead of cout.
	-Set m_SubBatchSize and m_FuseCount to default values in Ember::Clear().
	-Make EmberOptionEntry<T>::operator() return a const reference instead of a copy.
	-General cleanup.

0.9.9.5 Beta 03/04/2016
--User changes
	-None.
	
--Bug fixes
	-Fix crash when using Lanczos2 filter with color curves due to negative numbers. Fix by passing abs() of first argument to pow() in Renderer::GammaCorrection().
	-Fix crash in hexes with SP. Rounding error caused out of bounds index.
	-Do not reset locked affine scale on new flame or undo.
	-Gracefully recover from reading a bad palette file.
	-Gracefully recover from reading flame file with unknown params.
	-Available memory size checking in the final render dialog was accidentally removed during the multi-gpu work last year. Add it back in.

--Code changes
	-Migrate to Qt 5.5.1
	-Remove dependency projects from the solution. Move to a project design where they are built once via command line and stored in a /Deps folder.
		--Because of this, libpng is built as a static lib instead of a dll because that's what its command line makefile supports.
	--Remove libpng16.dll from Wix installer.
	-Remove all configs except for debug and release.
	-Remove all platforms except for x64.
	-Add #define __TBB_NO_IMPLICIT_LINKAGE 1 to prevent tbb from looking for tbb_debug.lib by default on debug builds.
	-Put Ember.rc in a filter folder in the project.
	-Place pragma warning disable statements in PCH files rather than in projects. This makes it easier when using Qt Creator.
	-Move all resource files to the MSVC folder.
	-Set all targets in QtCreator project to their lowercase names to be more *nix friendly. Set -l link statements to use these new lowercase names for ember and embercl.
	-Rework Qt projects to favor shadow builds.
	-Remove the symlinks.sh file and all references to it. It was never needed. Instead, just specify multiple include and link paths in the .pro files.
	-Change WIN32 to _WIN32.
	-Fix a few code warnings.
	-Make usage of VarFuncs more consistent by moving some global functions there.
	-Make CircleTrans1 a little safer by calling Zeps() on m_Sc during precalc.
	-Major work on Qt Creator builds.

0.9.9.4 Beta 02/21/2016
--User changes
	-Allow for stopping the renderer in the main window. This makes it more efficient when entering many parameters, such as when following a tutorial.
	-Add support for new variations: erf, gamma, jac_cn, jac_dn, jac_sn, logDB, pressure_wave, pRose3D, splits3D, w, waves2b, x, xerf, y, z.
	-Inform user of the start and stop of file parsing in EmberAnimate because the files could potentially be very large.
	-Move the follwing fields to a new table called Animation: Interpolation, Affine Interpolation, Temporal Samples, Temporal Filter Width, Temporal Filter Type.
		--These currently have no effect on the interactive renderer and instead are used when running flames through EmberGenome to generate sequences, and then animating them in Fractorium or EmberAnimate.
	-Add new parameter overrides for EmberRender and EmberAnimate which directly assign values to all flames being rendered, rather than scale:
		  --quality
		  --demin
		  --demax
	-Allow locking of the scale at which affine circles are displayed.
	-Allow user to toggle whether xform will be animated when generating sequences. Also show the animate value when loading.
	-Add variations changes to the list of functionality that can be applied to all xforms using the Select tab.
	-Allow for graphical affine adjustments to apply to multiple selected xforms.
	-Slight optimization of the pie variation.
	-Undo state is only saved when the render completes and the mouse buttons are released. This helps avoid intermediate steps for quickly completing renders while dragging.
	-Add some keyboard shortcuts for toolbar and menu items.
	-Make info tab tree always expanded.
	-Draw selection circles around all selected xforms plus the current one.
	
--Bug fixes
	-Crash when supersample minus final spatial filter width was negative.
	-Left pad instead of right pad names of sequence outputs from EmberGenome.
	-Unique file naming was broken for files which already had an underscore in them.
	-Properly report that png is the default format of EmberRender and EmberAnimate output instead of erroneously claiming it was jpg.
	-Make command line programs search these folders in this order for the palette file:
		./
		~/.fractorium
		~/.config/fractorium
		/usr/share/fractorium
		/usr/local/share/fractorium
	-Fix possible bad values in hexes.
	-Better assignment of Z variables.
	-Fix boarders due to use of poorly implemented rint() function from flam3. Use std::rint() now.
	-wedge_sph was completely wrong due to having accidentally swapped the mapping of two parameters.
	-Make juliascope juliascope_power parameter be of type REAL_NONZERO since it's used as a denominator.
	-Make Z assignment compatible with the originals in:
		--arch, bcircle, bCollide, bent, bent2, bisplit, blob, blur_linear, blur_square, bMod, boarders, boarders2, bSwirl, bTransform, butterfly, cardioid, cell, circleblur, circlize, circlize2, circus, collideoscope, cos, cosine, cosh, coth, cpow, cpow2, crescents, cropn, csc, csch, curl, curve, dc_gridout, deltaa, diamond, disc2, eclipse, eCollide, edisc, eJulia, elliptic, eMod, eMotion, ennepers, epispiral, ePush, eRotate, eScale, eSwirl, ex, exp, expo, exponential, fan, fdisc, fibonacci, fibonacci2, fisheye, flipcircle, flipy, flower, flux, funnel, glynnia, GlynnSim1, GlynnSim2, GlynnSim3, gridout, handkerchief, heart, hole, idisc, julia, julian2, juliaNab, kaleidoscope, lazyTravis, Lissajous, mask, MobiusN, mobius_strip, modulus, murl, murl2, npolar, ortho, oscilloscope, parabola, perspective, petal, phoenix_julia, pie (was also inconsistent between cpu and gpu), poincare, popcorn, popcorn2, power, pow_block, rational3, rays, rblur, rings, rippled, roundspher, sec, secant2, sigmoid, sin, sineblur, sinh, sinusgrid, sphericaln, spiralwing, spirograph, split, squarize, squirrel, squish, sschecks, starblur, stripes, stwin, super_shape, tan, tancos, tangent, tanh, TwinTrian, twoface, unpolar, waves, wavesn, wedge_julia, whorl, xheart, zblur, zscale.
	-Make precalcs for all hypertile variations safer by using Zeps() for denominators.
	-Changing the current xform with more than one selected would set all xform's color index value that of the current one.
	-Use hard found palette path information for randoms as well.
	-OpenCL build and assignment errors for Z value in epispiral variation.
	-Unitialized local variables in hexaplay3D, crob, pRose3D.
	-Devices settings was empty on first run, so switching to OpenCL had no effect until the user manually selected a device in the options dialog. Fix by defaulting to device 0 if present.
	-Add control key as a modifier to increase the amount a spinbox is changed when using right mouse drag to edit. Previously only observed shift key to decrease the value.
	-Change the copy/paste selected xforms shortcuts to be Ctrl+X+C and Ctrl+X+V.
	
--Code changes
	-Generalize Variation::PrecalcHelper() and rename to PrePostPrecalcHelper().
		--Do the same for the OpenCL version and rename it PrePostPrecalcOpenCLString().
	-Rename Variation::m_AssignType to m_PrePostAssignType since it's only relevant to pre/post variations.
	-More conversion to C++11 style code.
	-Add another value to the eXformUpdate enum called UPDATE_CURRENT_AND_SELECTED.
	-Remove some old #defines.
	-Change static member variables from m_ to s_.

	-Remove old IMAGEGL2D define from before Nvidia supported OpenCL 1.2.
	-Remove old CriticalSection code and use std::recursive_mutex.
	-Make Affine2D Rotate() and RotateTrans() take radians instead of angles.
	-Split VariationList into .h/cpp files.
		--Make VariationList.cpp the only place where the variations files are included from. This speeds up the build, but variations can no longer be directly instantiated.
		--Variations are no longer exported.
	-Add function Fractorium::IsXformSelected() to determine if an xform has been selected with the checkboxes.
	-Cleanup warnings.
	-General cleanup.
 
0.9.9.3 Beta 01/17/2016
--User changes
	-Add new variations: crackle, dc_perlin and post_smartcrop.
	-Make default palette interp mode be linear instead of step.
	-Make summary tab the selected one in the Info tab.
	-Allow for highlight power of up to 10. It was previously limited to 2.
	-Add the following modes to synth:
		-MODE_SHIFTNSTRETCH 14
		-MODE_SHIFTTANGENT 15
		-MODE_XMIRROR 17
		-MODE_XYMIRROR 18
		-MODE_SPHERICAL2 19

	-Wrong point assignment in hexaplay3D, hexnix3D.
	-Improper Z assignment in rblur.
	-Fix inconsistency with original in circlecrop.
	-synth was broken due to passing synth_mode to Interpolate, rather than synth_smooth.
	-Changes in the xaos grid were not always being processed due to rounding.
	-Long standing animation looping but that goes all the way back to flam3.
	
--Code changes
	-Qualify math function with std::
	-Allow for array precalc params in variations by adding a size member to the ParamWithName class.
	-In IterOpenCLKernelCreator, memcpy precalc params instead of a direct assign since they can now be of variable length.
	-Add new file VarFuncs to consolidate some functions that are common to multiple variations. This also contains texture data for crackle and dc_perlin.
	-Place OpenCL versions of these functions in the FunctionMapper class in the EmberCL project.
	-Add new Singleton class that uses CRTP, is thread safe, and deletes after the last reference goes away. This fixes the usual "delete after main()" problem with singletons that use the static local function variable pattern.
	-Began saving files with AStyle autoformatter turned on. This will eventually touch all files as they are worked on.
	-Add missing backslash to CUDA include and library paths for builds on Nvidia systems.
	-Add missing gl.h include for Windows.

	-Include a dark style with the installation called dark.qss.
	-Also add support for themes such as Fusion.
	-Resize some controls to better fit with the new style.
	-Add an option to specify the number of random embers generated on startup. 1 is the minimum and the default.
	-Add new variations: bubbleT3D, crob, hexaplay3D, hexcrop, hexes, hexnix3D, loonie2, loonie3, nBlur, octapol and synth.
	-Allow for pre/post versions of dc_bubble, dc_cylinder and dc_linear whereas before they were omitted.
	-When saving a file with multiple embers in it, detect if time values are all the same and if so, start them at zero and increment by 1 for each ember.
	-Allow for numerous quality increases to be coalesced into one. It will pick up at the end of the current render.
	-Show selection highlight on variations tree in response to mouse hover. This makes it easier to see for which variation or param the current mouse wheel action will apply.
	-Make default temporal samples be 100, whereas before it was 1000 which was overkill.
	-Require the shift key to be held with delete for deleting an ember to prevent it from triggering when the user enters delete in the edit box.
		-This wasn't otherwise fixable without writing a lot more code.
	
--Bug fixes
	-EmberGenome was crashing when generating a sequence from a source file with more than 2 embers in it.
	-EmberGenome was improperly handling the first frame of a merge after the last frame of the loop.
		-These bugs were due to a previous commit. Revert parts of that commit.
	-Prevent a zoom value of less than 0 when reading from xml.
	-Slight optimization of the crescents, and mask variations, if the compiler wasn't doing it already.
	-Unique file naming was broken because it was looking for _# and the default names ended with -#.
	-Disallow renaming of an ember in the library tree to an empty string.
	-Severe bug that prevented some variations from being read correctly from params generated outside this program.
	-Severe OpenCL randomization bug. The first x coordinates of the first points in the first kernel call of the first ember of a render since the OpenCL renderer object was created were not random and were mostly -1.
	-Severe bug when populating xform selection distributions that could sometimes cause a crash due to roundoff error. Fix by using double.
	-Limit the max number of variations in a random ember to MAX_CL_VARS, which is 8. This ensures they'll look the same on CPU and GPU.
	-Properly enable/disable thread priority label in final render dialog in response to enable/disable of the OpenCL checkbox.
	-Remove all inline stylesheets.
	-Show xaos spinners with 6 decimal places.
 
--Code changes
	-Generalize using the running sum output point inside of a variation for all cases: pre, reg and post.
	-Allow for array variables in variations where the address of each element is stored in m_Params.
	-Qualify all math functions with std::
	-No longer use our own Clamp() in OpenCL, instead use the standard clamp().
	-Redesign how functions are used in the variations OpenCL code.
	-Add tests to EmberTester to verify some of the new functionality.
	-Place more const and override qualifiers on functions where appropriate.
	-Add a global rand with a lock to be used very sparingly.
	-Use a map instead of a vector for bad param names in Xml parsing.
	-Prefix affine interpolation mode defines with "AFFINE_" to make their purpose more clear.
	-Allow for variations that change state during iteration by sending a separate copy of the ember to each rendering thread.
	-Implement this same functionality with a local struct in OpenCL. It's members are the total of all variables that need to change state within an ember.
	-Add Contains() function to Utils.h.
	-EmberRender: print names of kernels being printed with --dump_kernel option.
	-Clean up EmberTester to handle some of the recent changes.
	-Fix various casts.
	-Replace % 2 with & 1, even though the compiler was likely doing this already.
	-Add new file Variations06.h to accommodate new variations.
	-Remove redundant comparisons to nullptr, use ! instead;
	-Give some controls valid names instead of the auto generated ones.
	-DoubleSpinBoxTableItemDelegate.h: Add virtual keyword to overridden functions.
	-General cleanup.

	-Add automatic filename padding to animations in EmberAnimate and Fractorium.
	-Allow for multiple palette files rather than hard coding to flam3-palettes.xml.
	-Make xaos display a matrix in its own tab rather than a single column in the xforms tab.
	-Remove xaos from/to button since it's no longer applicable.
	-Add the ability to apply operations to a selection of xforms, rather than just the current one.
	-Add the ability to set the current xform by pressing F1 - F32.
	-Add the ability to toggle an entire row or column of xaos values.
	-Add the ability to click the right mouse button and drag to adjust values in spinners.

	-Sort palette list by name, instead of by index in the palette file.
	-Sorting can be flipped by clicking the column headers of the palette table.
	-Allow for detaching of top level tabs in the dock widget so workspaces can be customized and saved between runs.
	-Add linked xform support, with new button and icon on the xforms tab.
	-Add an additional animation motion function named Saw (Simon Detheridge).
	-Add motion support at the ember level instead of just individual xforms (Simon Detheridge).
	-Add an offset to existing motion elements, to start them partway through their cycle.
	-Add Summary tab to the info dock, place existing bounds related info in a new Bounds tab.
	-Add a toolbar with the most common actions on it, remove old toolbar at the top of the library tab.
	-Add variations filter/selection dialog that applied to randoms and is also saved in the settings.
	-Remove Hue as a saved parameter, as well as animation parameters associated with it. It's now a GUI-only field that is never saved.
	-Make histogram, density filter buffer, and all associated fields always float, even when using double. In that case, only the iteration calculations are now double. Suggested by Thomas Ludwig.
	-Print all three kernels in EmberRender when the --dump_kernel option is specified.
	-Add Simon Detheridge's name to the About Box.
	-Add support for multiple GPU devices.
		--These options are present in the command line and in Fractorium.
		--Change scheme of specifying devices from platform, device to just total device index.
			---Single number on the command line.
			---Change from combo boxes for device selection to a table of all devices in Fractorium.
	-Temporal samples defaults to 100 instead of 1000 which was needless overkill.
	-Make combo boxes have zero margins, they were getting clipped on Linux.
	-Make xform weight cell slightly wider, it was getting clipped on Linux.
	-Adjust height of final render dialog to make it look better on Linux.
	
--Bug Fixes
	-Fix status bar height on retina displays.

	-Fix clamping bug with DE filter widths.
	-Prevent extra newline in EmberRender when only rendering a single image.
	-Add and call ClearFinalImages() to clear buffers in controller to fix bug where previous CPU render would be shown for a split second when switching from OpenCL back to CPU.
	-Refactor ember library pointer syncing to a function SyncPointers().
	-Use a non-imbued stringstream to generate output filename.
	-Fix NAN in equalized weight calculation when all weights are set to 0.
	-Prevent xform index flickering whenever changing the number of xforms.
	-Fix tab tool tips again.
	-Only correct variation names/params during parsing when the source of the Xml file is not from Ember/Fractorium.

	-Properly disable add final xform button when a final xform is present.
	-Move some kernel initialization to a place where it's done once per render, rather than on every interactive iter chunk.
	-FractoriumXformsColor.cpp: Checking for null pixmap pointer is not enough, must also check if the underlying buffer is null via call to QPixmap::isNull().
	-Remove some old style sheet code on the xforms tab that doesn't seem to make sense and was probably just a workaround for a transient Qt bug, of which there are hundreds.
	-Set auto fill background for all of the nested tabs on the ui. This has ping ponged back and forth since the beginning of this project.
	
--Code Changes
	-General code cleanup in many places.
	-Major work to build on Mac and Linux.
	-Better use of const functions.
	-Force all float literals in OpenCL variations to correct precision.
	-Remove ReadMe.txt from all project files.
	-Provide functions to return the kernels from RendererCL to assist with diagnostics and debugging.
	-Remove unnecessary resize() in Interpolate().
	-Explicitly namespace calls to sqrt() and isnan().
	-Clean up strange nested usage of Update([&]()) calls when changing xform color index via either the spinner or scroll bar. Made no sense.
	-Make ISAAC RandBit() use RandByte() to be slightly more efficient.
	-Put FillXforms() in the controller where it belongs, rather than the main window class.
	-Add UpdateXform() function to the controller to handle applying operations to multiple xforms.
	-Remove the word "Current" out of most xform related functions because they now operate on whatever is selected.
	-Properly use Update() for various xform operations whereas before it was manually calling UpdateRender().
	-Also properly use Update() in places where it was erroneously using UpdateXform() for things that did not involve xforms.
	-Block signals in FillXaosTable().
	-Add new file named FractoriumXformsSelect.cpp to handle new xform selection code.
	-Remove ForEach() wrappers and replace with range based for loops with auto.
	-Replace every regular for loop with a range based one where applicable. Note this doesn't work everywhere.
	-Make event filter application wide.
	-Add parameter to FillXforms() to specify the index to select, default 0.
	-Rename some scroll areas and layouts to names that make sense, rather than their designer defaults.
	-Fix some pedantic gcc errors about missing template keyword.
	-Use QTableView instead of QTableWidget for the xaos table.
	-Remove unnecessary connect() statement in Variations tab.
	-Variation tree and associated widgets no longer actually contain variation objects, only IDs.
	-Refactor code to make a color visible on a background into VisibleColor() in FractoriumCommon.h
	-Add IsXformLinked() to determine if an xform is linked to another.
	-Remove SetPaletteRefTable() and GetQRgbFromPaletteIndex() from FractoriumEmberControllerBase and its derivations, unused.
	-Add FillSummary() to FractoriumEmberController. Call in Update(), UpdateXform() and other places where values are changed to force an update of the summary view.
	-Add export statements to FractoriumInfo.cpp.
	-Remove image parameter from SetPaletteTableItem(), it was a bad design.
	-Refactor code to get a palette color at a given index and convert it to a QColor to ColorIndexToQColor().
	-Remove a file named Fractorium.aps which had been erroneously committed a year ago.
	-Use qobject_cast instead of dynamic_cast where appropriate.
	-Add more override keyword where appropriate.
	-Add small function ShutdownAndRecreateFromOptions() to wrap shutting down the timer and recreating the renderer.
	-Use the overridden accept() and reject() functions more consistently across dialogs.
	-De-templatized DEOpenCLKernelCreator and FinalAccumOpenCLKernelCreator. They now just take a bool as a parameter to specify double precision.
	-To accommodate the buffers being float, introduce a new #define types in EmberCL called real4_bucket, and real4reals_bucket.
	-Density and spatial filtering structs now use this type.
	-ConvertDensityFilter() and ConvertSpatialFilter() no longer return a value, they just assign to the member.
	-Make ConvertCarToRas() just assign to the member rather than return a struct.

	--ClearBuffer(), ReadPoints(), WritePoints(), ReadHist() and WriteHist() now optionally take a device index as a parameter.
	--MakeDmap() override and m_DmapCL member removed because it no longer applies since the histogram is always float since the last commit.
	--Add new function SumDeviceHist() to sum histograms from two devices by first copying to a temporary on the host, then a temporary on the device, then summing.
	--m_Calls member removed, as it's now per-device.

	Save each newly loaded ember in a file called "last.flame" in the executable folder. This will help diagnose crashes that occur when switching embers.
	Use nullptr instead of NULL in the Fractorium project. It had previously been done in all other places.

--Code Changes
	Pass count and fuse to iterator as a structure now to allow for passing more params in the future.
	Slightly different grid/block logic when running DE filtering on the GPU.
	Attempt a different way of doing DE, but #define out because it ended up not being faster.
	Restructure some things to allow for a variable length xforms buffer to be passed to the GPU.
	Add sub batch size and fuse count as ember members, and remove them from the renderer classes.
	Remove m_LastPass from Renderer. It should have been removed with passes.

	Unique filename on final render was completely broken.
	Two severe OpenCL bugs. Random seeds were biased and fusing was being reset too often leading to results that differ from the CPU.
	Subtle, but sometimes severe bug in the setup of the xaos weights.
	Use properly defined epsilon by getting the value from std::numeric_limits, rather than hard coding 1e-6 or 1e-10.
	Omit incorrect usage of epsilon everywhere. It should not be automatically added to denominators. Rather, it should only be used if the denominator is zero.
	Force final render progress bars to 100 on completion. Sometimes they didn't seem to make it there.
	Make variation name and params comparisons be case insensitive.

	Add defines: M_2PI, M_3PI, CUBE, TLOW, TMAX, m3T, acosh and fma. The last two will be removed once the project moves to C++11 in the future.

EmberFile
	Add UniqueFilename() function to ensure what we save is never overwritten with subsequent saves.

EmberTester
	Add many test functions to test the integrity of the Variations design. This will be made into a formal testing suite in the future, but for now is just a collection of global functions.

EmberToXml
	Write out legacy symmetry field in addition to color speed for each xform.
	Write out name field for each xform for Apo compatibility.

FinalRenderDialog
	Add MoveCursorToEnd() signal function to be called from the final render thread.

	Make functions inline.
	Add check for modulo zero in ranged Rand().

	Add new int Floor<T>(T val) function that is faster than the system floor() and use it everywhere. Time test proved to be faster.

Variation
	Complete redesign of variations. Split into multiple files to avoid one becoming unweildy.
	Each variation will have a type: pre, regular or post, and will have an assignment type that dictates how the results will be assigned to the output points: direct assign or sum, to be used in pre and post variations. Regular ones always sum.
	Variation enums are now sorted alphabetically rather than the traditional arbitrary sorting of flam3.
	Add Precalc() and PrecalcOpenCLString() functions to be called with pre and post variations. Placed here instead of xform because they depend on the variation type, pre or post.
	Add additional functions to help handle pre/post logic and naming.
	Add fields to specify valid value ranges for parametric params. Taken from Apo.
	Reserve 5 for params vector in parametric variations.
	Add randomization function for parametric variations.

	Add support for 3D fields, direct color, and the legacy symmetry field.
	Correct poorly named variations and their parameters.
	Remove Isaac member and use the new global one instead.

	
0.3.7.3 Beta 05/04/2014 (Intermediate commit without an associated release)

	Fix a bug that reset the render when adjusting a parameter of a variation whose weight was zero. Now only update the render if the variation is actually present with a non-zero weight.
	Add many new variations, with more to come. Any Z coordinate functionality has been commented out for the time being until 3D support is added.
	Preserve xform index during undo/redo.
	In EmberRender and EmberAnimate, report iters as ran/requested rather than requested/ran.

--Code Changes
Solution
	Update glm, libjpeg, libpng, libxml2 and tbb to their latest versions.
	Change include/link order for every project for all configurations and platforms to prefer AMD over nVidia since AMD's OpenCL support is more current.

0.3.7.2 Beta 04/16/2014
--User Changes
	Fix bug where images with a high number of bad values would crash the rendering process on nVidia cards.

--Code Changes

Variations
	Begin implementing more variations from Apophysis, but leave them disabled for now.

Ember
	Fixed a bug when adding symmetry to an ember that sorted all of the xforms by color speed value, instead of only the newly added symmetry xforms.

IterOpenCLKernelCreator
	Fixed a bug where final xform was considered for the randomly selected xform during each iteration. It was never actually hit, but should have never been there regardless.
	Major change in how bad values were being handled. They were failing out on nVidia but running ok on AMD, but giving worse images. Now it's done in a while loop to avoid severe warp divergence.


0.3.7.1 Beta 04/07/2014
--User Changes
	Fixed a bug that accidentally disabled double precision support on nVidia cards in the last commit.

Fractorium
	New functions to allow updating the preview renders from within a thread better.

FractoriumLibrary
	Better flushing of event queues when starting and stopping preview renderer.
	Place a try/catch block around EmberTreeItemChanged() because it seems to get called spurriously for tree items that have already been deleted.

FractoriumEmberController
	Fix bug where Fractorium would crash when opening a new file before the preview renders were finished by doing two things: Updating the thumbnail via invokeMethod() and using BlockingQueuedConnection for that call.

	Bug fix in EmberGenome that would crash when creating a sequence that included embers with final Xforms in them.

--Code Changes

Ember
	Add two members to preserve the original raster width and height of an ember as it was read from file. This is used for aspect ratio calculations later on.
	
EmberDefines
	Add two new enums for render status and scaling preference.

EmberToXml
	Make some buffers size 128 instead of 100.
	Add function AddFilenameWithoutAmpersand() to ensure an ampersand is never added to the edits because Xml can't parse those.
	Error in ConvertLinearToPolar() was calling GetXform(). Changed to GetTotalXform().

PaletteList
	Use a string instead of a vector because it's needed now to deal with ampersands.

Renderer, RendererCL
	Rendering functions now no longer return just true or false. Rather, they return an enum indicating whether it ran ok, with an error, or aborted.
	Ok function was inadvertently made not to be an override in OpenCL. Fixed by adding const to match the base.

SheepTools
	Clean up to use our modern design instead of some remnants left over from flam3.
	Consolidate variation weight normalization to a function call, NormalizeVariationWeights().

FinalRenderEmberController
	Add support for preview renders.
	Support for new scaling features.
	Use new CreateRenderer() function.

Fractorium
	Add support for drag n drop of multiple files at once.
	Better drag n drop code.

	Add commas to various command line numerical outputs to make them easier to read.
	Apply sort mode to variations list every time filter is changed or cleared.
	Prevent crash when clicking on main window before initialization is complete on program startup.

--Code Changes

	Holding shift while scrolling xform weight adjusts the value by 0.001 for more precise manipulation.

--Code Changes

CarToRas
	Prevent assign to self.
	Remove padded variables for bounds checking, and check bounds properly. Also discovered that even when points are in bounds, the roundoff error from converting to raster can put them out of bounds. Add a final check in Accum.

DensityFilter
	General cleanup.
	Save the filter width (oddly enough, this wasn't being done before).
	Add a vector of indices that is used in OpenCL to apply the filter by row, rather than moving from the center outward. This fixes a race condition when applying the DE filter on the GPU.
	Remove FinalMinRad, FinalMaxRad and ActualMaxRad members and accessor functions.

Affine2D, Color, Ember, Palette, Point, Variation, Xform
	Prevent assign to self.

Renderer
	Fully setup gutter width the way smoulder does.
	In GaussianDensityFilter(), do a more optimized assignment of the bucket hit count if SS=1.
	Reorder the assignments for the case (jj == ii) to be cache efficient.
	In Accumulate(), add one final check after Car to Ras conversion to make absolutely sure it's within bounds. This was the source of a seldom occurring, but lethal memory error.

EmberToXml
	Clamp supersample to always be greater than 1 just to be safe.

XmlToEmber
	Add a Parse() overload that takes a vector<unsigned char>.
	More consistent formatting of error messages.
	Add, but comment out, an attempt to capture missing variations when parsing. Revisit later.

FractoriumEmberController, FractoriumMenus
	Properly account for scale when opening from file, dragging and dropping, or pasting Xmls into the GUI.

FractoriumParams
	Allow brightness to go to 50 and gamma to go to 9999.
	Allow spatial filter width to go down to 0.1, was 0.4 before.

FractoriumRender
	Renderer was not properly being created when returning from options if params other than OpenCL or double precision were changed. Now properly construct for all options changes.

FractoriumSettings
	Default XmlSupersample to 2 if not found in settings file.

FractoriumXformsAffine
	Respect world vs. local pivot when flipping affine to mimic Apophysis behavior. Was previously always using world pivot behavior.
	
FractoriumXformsColor
	NULL check for empty pixmap on startup.

GLWidget
	Check for m_Init in SetSelectedXform() to avoid recursive paint operation.

EmberCLStructs
	Remove pad members from CarToRas structures to mirrow the CPU side.
	
EmberCLFunctions
	Remove AddToAccum functions, they are no longer used with new DE code. Add AccumCheck() function to check bounds, but not accumulate.
	Change CarToRasInBounds() to check bounds the same way the new CPU code does.

IterOpenCLKernelCreator
	Add histSize parameter to kernel.
	Add (histIndex < histSize) check after call to CarToRasConvertPointToSingle() to match the extra check done on the CPU side now. This will guarantee memory errors will never happen while iterating.

RendererCL
	Add support for different block widths and heights for DE.
	Add a DE coefficients buffer for applying DE by row, which fixes the race condition problem that occurs when applying from the center outward.
	DE blocksize is now 32x32, unless SS>1 or type is double, in which case they run at 32x30.
	Add debugging code in GaussianDensityFilter() to fall back to the CPU for testing, leave commented out.

DEOpenCLKernelCreator
	Re-design to apply filter by row, rather than from the center outward. This solves the race condition error that would lead to missing pixels on some images.
	Eliminate needless variables and make every effort to get the kernel as compact as possible. This allows running a block size of 32x32.
	Rename blockHistCol and blockHistRow to threadHistCol and threadHistRow since that's what they are.
	In CreateGaussianDEKernel(), have the last row accumulate since it's slightly faster than having the first row do it.
	In CreateGaussianDEKernel(), Change the local buffer to be size 3000.


0.3.1.0 Beta 01/06/2014
--User Changes
	Changing size when dragging in an image (orig -> window), resizing (window -> window), or doing a final render (window -> final render) now compensates for scale (pixels per unit).
	Spatial filter width now allows values >= 0 and defaults to 0.4.
	All spinners now scroll by the normal step / 10 when holding shift. Variation spinners are a special case and scroll by 0.001 with shift held down.
	Final render now shows pure render time along with total time.	
	Fix bug in final render dialog where only the first image in the file would get rendered.
	Installer will now uninstall the previous version automatically.
	Installer now includes this file.
	About box now fully specifies version with 4 digits.

-Ember
	Add function SetSizeAndAdjustScale() to adjust the scale for a size change.

-RendererCL
	Report error when adding spatial filter params fails, which can happen when GPU memory runs out.

-DoubleSpinBox
	Add m_Step and m_SmallStep members to specify how much to scroll by based on the keyboard modifier.

-FinalRenderEmberController
	Add m_TotalTimer member to differentiate between render time and total time.
