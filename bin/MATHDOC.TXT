This is mathematical expressions calculator. You can use it at command
prompt just like this:
        math 4*sin(30)/(5-1)
        math /h                will display a short help message.
or
        math /r 2^3/cos(pi) 

/r tells the program to use radians.  Above means "2 raised to power 3
divided by cos(3.1415926536), the result is -8.

You can use it also interactively by entering only:

    math

You will then see the welcome screen. Next you can continue entering
expressions and watching results, possibly using 26 memory registers
(named with single letter a..z) available to store intermediate
results. 

Version 2.0 adds possibility to define 20 user functions. To use this
feature start interactive math and type:

        def:name(p0,p1,...,p9)=expression

The name of a function may be a combination of 2 to 6 letters and
digits, starting with a letter. p0 to p9 are formal parameters, you
can have from 0 to 10 of this parameters. Examples of function
definitions:

   def:cot(p0) = 1/tan(p0)    defines function cotangent
   def:const=-15.67           defines some constant
   def:doubx=2*x              returns double contents of register x 
   def:dst(p0,p1) = sqrt(p0*p0 + p1*p1)

You can use these functions in your calculations like this:

   5 + dst(3*5.7, cos(25)*x)

You can also separate several expressions with commas. They will be
executed in sequence and the last result will be printed. Example:

   x = 2, y = x+3, y + y

will print 10.

Standard functions:     
acos(x)     arccosine of x
asin(x)     arcsine of x
atan(x)     arctangent of x
cos(x)      cosine of x
sin(x)      sine of x
tan(x)      tangent of x
deg(x)      change radians into degrees
rad(x)      change degrees into radians
exp(x)      exponential value of x (base is math e=2.71828183 constant)
ln(x)       natural logarithm of x (base e)
log(x)      base 10 logarithm of x
round(x)    round the value x to the nearest integer
sqrt(x)     square root of x (x must be positive or 0)
abs(x)      absolute (non-negative) value of x
cosh(x)     hyperbolic cosine of x
sinh(x)     hyperbolic sine of x
tanh(x)     hyperbolic tangent of x
pi          PI constant (3.1415926536...)
last        previously calculated value

Operators:
+(add)  -(subtract, minus)  *(multiply)  /(divide)  %(modulo)  ^(exponent)
'=' assigns a value to one letter memory register (for later use), e.g.
                 x = sin(30)/(5*log(2) - 2^3)


One letter commands:
/d  set angle unit to Degrees            /q  Quit (or press Ctrl-C)
    (default at start)                   /r  set angle unit to Radians
/h  to see Help                          /s  Show a...z memory registers
/f  display User Defined Functions       /c  clear all functions & regs.
/v  saVe                                 /l  load
