What done the split of all 242.xml.txt into individual .xml (later .flam3) files for every sheep in the flock was this command:

cygwin command:
xml_split all_242.xml

. . . and somehow I installed something on cygwin to get that command. xml twig?

previous, working, far less efficient method, from bash:

# RE: http://www.labnol.org/software/wget-command-examples/28750/
wget --execute robots=off --recursive --no-parent --accept flam3,html --no-clobber http://electricsheep.com/archives/generation-242/

There are 2,013,183 possible children among all the sheep in generation 242, if you mutate each pair three different ways.

It is feasible to thus cross-breed them all and render thumbnails for all of them. But it may be an enormous undertaking.
